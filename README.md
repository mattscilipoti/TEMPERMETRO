# TEMPERMETRO

Are you tired of waiting 24 minutes for the next DC metro train to arrive? Tired of hearing that you will be late to your destination because the DC metro is single tracking again? Hate that the air-conditioning system on the metro conveniently breaks all summer? Are you furious at the fact that the DC metro hasn't improved at all in the last ten years?

Well, the app to vent your metro frustrations is finally here! Tempermetro (made to sound like temperamental), is an app made for DC residents and tourists to vent their frustrations. This app may be our last hope to change the crumbling system.

## Technology Used:
+ Rails
+ Adobe Premiere (to edit the background video).
+ camera to film the background video
+ HTML and CSS

## Approach taken
Since I'm a visual person I had to have a good idea of how the final app will look visually before I could actually start with the CRUD functionality. Once my wireframes looked good I began working on each CRUD functionality step and then created users and a log in page.

## Unsolved problems

I wanted to make sure my application looked good on various browsers and platforms, so I used media queries to make my site responsive. My application currently looks good on large monitors and android phones, however, I realized that the Safari browser on iPhones has its own default styling that it applies to submit buttons. Thus the styling that I applied to my submit button is being overridden.

Also, my TEMPERMETRO site logo is created with the Arial-Black font which is not available on all browsers. So I think I will need to replace the TEMPERMETRO text based logo with an image that says "TEMPERMETRO" in arial-black so that it appears the same on all browsers.
