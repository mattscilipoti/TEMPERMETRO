# TEMPERMETRO

Are you tired of waiting 24 minutes for the next DC metro train to arrive? Tired of hearing that you will be late to your destination because the DC metro is single tracking again? Hate that the air-conditioning system on the metro conveniently breaks all summer? Are you furious at the fact that the DC metro hasn't improved at all in the last ten years?

Well, the app to vent your metro frustrations is finally here! Tempermetro (made to sound like temperamental), is an app made for DC residents and tourists to vent their frustrations. This app may be our last hope to change the crumbling system.
